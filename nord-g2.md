Until I have my ideal engine (which may never happen), I remain devoted to my
Nord G2X, one of the greatest synthesizers ever made.

Alas, it has been unsupported for years now, and as of Mac OS X Catalina, the
desktop editing software will no longer run on a Mac.

On 2020-09-03, I sent Nord Keyboards a short note via their tech support form,
begging them to release the editor software's code.

I doubt it will sway anything, but I thought I should at least make the appeal.
